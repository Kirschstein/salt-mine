Consuming the powers turns the UD in the GY into a powerless UD Wight though.  However if you can construct it right, you can get the OGNecro to revive someone into another avatar, then later on if the OGNecro dies, you can Ghoul-consume their power to become a Necro yourself and therefore get a second Necro in the game.","Recipients":["ImTownSRSLY","Diamond_Dove","sikuangyud","orucsoraihc","GameLover","Zombie"],"Eavesdroppers":["Default-Eavesdropper"],"GameId":"rox-428","TimeStamp":"2020-04-15T21:15:50.5815625Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.CovenNightMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Henners","Message":"So.

I thought about how I would defend myself if accused of visiting somebody I wasn't aware of. I anticipated the excitement if I were to find a report of people visiting me. And I considered what I would say in case my blood had been found to be tainted. Being on the villager side, I would of course point out the possibility of lycan but also acknowledge that the village would feel safer without me. For this reason, the aggressive “defence” that we have seen tonight in no way conveys to me the situation of a villager who has found out something unpleasant about themselves but still has the interest of the village at heart. Now, the logic of the impossibility to verify our seer also escapes me, since a beholder would be able to distinguish between a seer’s viewpoint (alignment only) and a bloodhound’s viewpoint (exact role). Likewise, I feel a couple of other points of logic have been overseen, and this is why I distrust the people that rushed to EvilMorty’s defence. However, I have no special information - so I only go by what people say, how they say it, and how logical it sounds to me.

I thought about how I would defend myself if accused of visiting somebody I wasn't aware of. I anticipated the excitement if I were to find a report of people visiting me. And I considered what I would say in case my blood had been found to be tainted. Being on the villager side, I would of course point out the possibility of lycan but also acknowledge that the village would feel safer without me. For this reason, the aggressive “defence” that we have seen tonight in no way conveys to me the situation of a villager who has found out something unpleasant about themselves but still has the interest of the village at heart. Now, the logic of the impossibility to verify our seer also escapes me, since a beholder would be able to distinguish between a seer’s viewpoint (alignment only) and a bloodhound’s viewpoint (exact role). Likewise, I feel a couple of other points of logic have been overseen, and this is why I distrust the people that rushed to EvilMorty’s defence. However, I have no special information - so I only go by what people say, how they say it, and how logical it sounds to me.

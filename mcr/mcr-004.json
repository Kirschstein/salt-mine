I identified a pool of people I wanted to vote into that day (Mark, Savvy, Ellie, Apiana) and voted Savvy, broadly because he was pushing that Cali and XII were Wolves together, which I thought much less likely than the alternative. I also pointed out (but forgot) that it was likely that the BH had joined in the false Seer claims, which left that pool of people on D3 being me, Kirsch and Savvy, which bolstered my decision to vote for Savvy. Though Mark was in my pool, I didn't vote for him that day, I stuck it out on Savvy. On D4, I tried to engage with Eadred to get more explanation from him about where his thoughts lay. As a Wolf, it would have been easier to just leave engaging with Eadred to make him an easier candidate to kill. I decided I wanted to vote between Ellie and Savvy again, and went with Ellie this time. I also made an argument at the end of the day that it was better to kill Eadred than have a missing vote for D5, as that would give two living Wolves vote parity. However, I then didn't vote for him for some reason, so I don't gain points for that. I don't think the votes were close. Yesterday, I continued in my suspicion of Ellie and Savvy and ultimately voted Savvy. If there were two living Wolves with Savvy as one of them, I could have switched to Ellie and won the game yesterday. I didn't, which likely establishes me as not in a Wolf team with Savvy (although it doesn't guarantee it). So I think the only viable Wolf team that I could be on would be me, Shane and Eadred. I obviously think that people should see it as unlikely that I was Wolves with Shane, but that's a judgement call. I think it isn't unreasonable to think I could have been Wolves with Eadred. But overall, I think I have poked into lots of people, tried to bring clarity and stop distractions, voted for at least one Wolf, and not taken the easy routes when they would otherwise have been available to me.","GameId":"mcr-004","TimeStamp":"2021-02-09T14:05:14.4424664Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.GhostMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Message":"I

This could also mean that the current claimed visit-intel roles are not all village, because evils are still anticipating a counter-claim, but this thought might be too far-fetched, especially because village also doesn't know whether counter-claims will still come (so what I'm saying is pure conjecture!!).... Anyway. They assume that wolfpack hit protection N1, then chose the same target N2. This seems a logical strategy for killing roles, but I hadn't thought it obvious. Pointy seems to assume this is what happened, he might seem to know it? (He's looking for the Protector that blocked the N1 kill).... Then he goes on about Succubi, and how redirects may fog up this image of protector-visits. But then again: Protectors do know when they're redirected afaik.

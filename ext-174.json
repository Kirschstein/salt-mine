Any player in the game tries to maximize their winning chance. If a village-aligned player knows/assumes they can't be recruited they will play to maximize village winning chance. But if there is a significant chance of them being recruited, say 25%, their optimal strategy changes, even before they're recruited. For the example, let's assume that there are 2 strategies a villager can follow, and we can quantify the average pay-off of this strategy. One strategy, called A, has a pay-off of 100 when the player adopting it remains village throughout the game, but has a payoff of -25 when the player is recruited by Vamp(Master). Then there is strategy B, which has an average payoff of 80 when the player remains village, but has an average payoff of 100 when the player is recruited in the game. Now let's compute the numbers for A and B, taking into account  the 75% chance of remaining village, and 25% chance of being recruited. Then the average weighted payoff of strategy A is (0.75x100 + 0.25x(-25)) = 68.75. The average weighted payoof of strategy B is (0.75x80 + 0.25x100) = 85. So this means that it is optimal for a village-aligned player to play strategy B, which is not the optimal strategy for village, even though the player is village at first.","GameId":"ext-174","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1505504076743+0000)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Shabas","Message":"2VMs was just an example, the important point is that the chance of becoming recruited gets significant (like 25% for example).","GameId":"ext-174","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1505504101443+0000)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Shabas","Message":"Sorry if I'm confusing you with numbers","GameId":"ext-174","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1505504120403+0000)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Shabas","Message":"It's Friday night - I'm drinking and now throwing around game theory and math, lol.

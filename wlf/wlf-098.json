We have a big problem in the killers on our team are inactive at night. Most of the rest speaks during the day before reading up on the night chat, so we had a fuckup in the GD department today. Thank goodness Claude (the real GD going for Simza) was blocked or René could have been lynched. SO PLEASE DISCUSS PLANS AND LOOK BACK TOMORROW FOR LAST-MINUTE CHANGES. Here is what I think MUST HAPPEN tonight: Carruthers: kill Dredger (adjudicator). Gladstone: kill Claude Ravache (GD). Cossack: block Ravache again, in case he gets protected and discovers Simza was SS. René: mark Coward, and tomorrow claim Irene was Diseased and start lynch trains on Coward and Cecil. If anyone does not follow this plan without presenting a valid counter argument, I promise you I will claim seer and out that person as a wolf. We need to start working together now and stop messing around. Cooperate and we may still have a chance.

Thank goodness Claude (the real GD going for Simza) was blocked or René could have been lynched. SO PLEASE DISCUSS PLANS AND LOOK BACK TOMORROW FOR LAST-MINUTE CHANGES. Here is what I think MUST HAPPEN tonight: Carruthers: kill Dredger (adjudicator). Gladstone: kill Claude Ravache (GD). Cossack: block Ravache again, in case he gets protected and discovers Simza was SS. René: mark Coward, and tomorrow claim Irene was Diseased and start lynch trains on Coward and Cecil. If anyone does not follow this plan without presenting a valid counter argument, I promise you I will claim seer and out that person as a wolf.

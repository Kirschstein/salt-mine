That said, I perfectly understand if, given my actions, you believe that I am a wolf. I have not been active throughout the day, and did not contribute much to D3 or D4. My attempts to play devil's advocate have been geared towards making sure our reasoning is ironclad and does not have any holes in it, but I recognize that the set of claims that I have been playing devil's advocate against (primarily Stewie's and Opie's D3 and Lois's D4) may make me look like a werewolf attempting to discredit villagers. If you are convinced that I am a wolf and lynch me tomorrow, I will accept that.","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:26:22.1960066Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"Its okay, right now my vanilla discrediting is focused on Muriel, Peter, and Buzzkill","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:27:05.9784386Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"All three have been relatively flying under the radar by not contributing.","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:27:29.2901188Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"TheHans255","Message":"That isn't what I concluded from \"(iM oNlY PlAYinG dEviLs AdVocATe)\"","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:27:57.6981445Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"I know, I moved on from that","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:28:56.8987093Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"china_man","Message":"i could say the same as tricia, but i just wanna sabe the bear","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:29:44.9927702Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"china_man","Message":"save","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:29:50.0438502Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"china_man","Message":"im not gonna lie to yall","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:29:55.9149552Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Diamond_Dove","Message":"Carter Tue 16:27 Its okay, right now my vanilla discrediting is focused on Muriel, Peter, and Buzzkill  <--- are you fking kidding me?","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:29:59.246753Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"china_man","Message":"the bear is cute","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:30:00.0555848Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Vodrin","Message":"those were my three least suspicious people peter","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:30:24.7461412Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Vodrin","Message":"odd eh","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:30:26.953845Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Diamond_Dove","Message":"Flying under the radar?","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:30:28.0035831Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"everyone is offended, okay","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:30:29.0662951Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"china_man","Message":"hello peter","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:30:30.8630827Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"china_man","Message":"ill say ur pretty lit","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:30:39.5510204Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Diamond_Dove","Message":"I've said a fair more bit than Carter that's for sure, and definitely have tried to be more useful","GameId":"wlf-095","TimeStamp":"2019-12-10T16:30:47.5879734Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Diamond_Dove","Message":"The word of a Chicken.

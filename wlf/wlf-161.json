I find it unlikely that the wolves chose intentionally to no-kill (the chance of a potential Court blocking a SS is fairly small and doesn't justify not killing imo). But again, that logic also means it is unlikely the potential Court managed to block the killing wolf. And it is also unlikely that the wolves actually managed to hit a prot.

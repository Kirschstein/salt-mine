I thought I was the only one left to speak and the least sus so I thought I had a high chance for the fake claim or a cc. and whatever I'm going to my claim must reflect in my words too. So I decided to wait. Also at that moment everyone was agreeing to wait for a TR read and deciding to not vote out Mesousa. I was stuck at that time my usual time the last two hours. Even they were pointing to me I had relief I wasn't that sus when compared to many others. So I decided to not show up and make up a reason maybe Sunday busy . But the shoot ; don't worry. If I was that active it might have gone to a SS in our team who're still useful. But the previous days other than yesterday. Yeah. I wanted to speak. But I don't know what to speak, maybe a casual chat? I hadn't, much things to say most of them were about the shot, wrong or correct, which would be pinpointing Kyu , or something obvious or something that doesn't go with the flow of the then chat. Yeah I hadn't alot of things to tell. But I'm sorry, I know lack of activity is something is not something to be justified whatever is the reason.

(Both dug wp - BL i think)  5) Crunch used the term \"Vanillager\" 2 out of 3 times when referring to Village/Vanilla. Crunch never used it in 8 references up to Crunch's death. Then 2 x days after Crunch dies, 'Count' comes out with a \"Vanillager\".    In 7 days of chat, that term has been used only once other time, by CornF (lynched). It's not a common term.

So  I assume 5 wolves left (5v7) we need to lynch!!!!!!!!  Damn gd is crucial! I assume bh is in advantage now  Seer should report everything seen even good, so that we can use elimination method   My suggestion vote the one who’s asv but no discussion at all to force them say something, if not satisfied they will be lynched (I might dead after speak this, if true then my assumption works)  I repeat seer SHOULDN’T keep quiet even there’s no prot we can focus on the other unknown roles!!! Hopefully drunkharlot is still here, wake up!!!!! xD  My role is villager, i might be sleepwalker or not but I don’t know  you can suggest something to force intels out, if your reason is not much info i can understand but seems you guys are not finding ways to win other than relying intels…..smh  So based on day 3, my suspecting on 5 wolves remaining might be: colonel, number two, number six, jammer, number 5….these fives are the worst among 13+1 ppl in day 3 chats….

It’s possible but that relies on an early militia claim which is bold for a wolf even if you’ve already killed the militia. Or if Brand was a wolf that Janna shot. Anyway none of that is possible because there were two deaths last night and there are only two possible reasons for that because there isn’t an alpha or a huntsman in this set up.  1. Jhin shifted into someone else or was killed by the wolves (to make us think he shifted, but this would rely on Warwick being a wolf from the start which I don’t think is true) and Graves was/wasn’t the seer (depending). Anyone could be comprised. Janna must have shot Brand in the night unless there is a hidden militia who didn’t cc yesterday or shoot the other person claiming Militia. Therefore if Brand was a wolf we’re at 3 wolves but god knows where Jhin is.  2. Jhin either shifted or was killed by the wolves (to make us think he shifted, but this would rely on Warwick being a wolf from the start which I don’t think is true) and Brand was the ML who died trying to recruit a wolf, in which case Janna is lying.  I’m inclined to believe Janna even though I don’t agree with their action. I think Jhin was a wolf, Warwick may or may not be lit because a wolf would know that Graves was the seer and Janna killed Brand randomly in the night.

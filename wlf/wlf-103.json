As for Cerys he did push for a non lynch and the argument used by Keira was that no wolf would do  that. I think that maybe a wolf would do it just because we wont think he would. If Geralt is evil he must be shifted. No way he is evil from the start. I can't say the same for Cerys. He could have been left alone as a wolf trying to go through this and in doing so he would suggest things that wolves would probably never suggest. As for myself. When It came to seer vs bh i tried to understand things from both sides, and i see vernon as a seer, when dandelion missed his gd check if i was a wolf i would put so much shade there yet I did not. When Geralt shot Vernon and no one else was killed i would put shade there yet I did not. From the very begining up until now I am engaging in every discussion.

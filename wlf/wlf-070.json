Cookie Monster builds excitement by answering his opening rhetorical question, \"Now what starts with the letter C?\" with the obvious reply, \"Cookie starts with C!\" He then challenges the audience, \"Let's think of other things that starts with C,\" before quickly replying, \"Oh, who cares about the other things?\" casually dismissing a whole range of other possibilities as irrelevant. Thus, having ostensibly come for the purpose of covering the letter C in its entirety, Cookie Monster has already focused his agenda exclusively on cookies, employing the classic bait and switch tactic.  Several times in his presentation, Cookie Monster emphasizes what appears to be the central thesis of his remarks: \"C is for cookie, that's good enough for me!\" The appealing rhythm of this slogan appears designed to entrance listeners, swaying their emotions and making them instinctively want to chant along with him. After rousing the crowd, Cookie Monster systematically lays out the logical underpinnings of his pro-cookie ideology, comparing cookies to round donuts with one bite out of them and to the moon during its crescent phase, in essence using a straw man argument that implies his opponents would advocate the superiority of these competitors over cookies. In this sense, Cookie Monster may be proposing a false dichotomy representing cookies as the only viable choice to a group of obviously inferior alternatives.  But before the audience has a chance to catch on, Cookie Monster launches into another round of repetitive chanting, \"C is for cookie, that's good enough for me, yeah!\" as young children sing along. Here, Cookie Monster uses a propaganda technique strikingly similar to that employed in George Orwell's Animal Farm by the pig Napoleon, who trained the farm's sheep to bleat, \"Four legs good, two legs bad\" on his cue.  Cookie Monster then adds visual stimulation to his discourse by chomping into a large cookie, concluding his remarks with \"Umm-umm-umm-umm-umm\" and other chewing sounds.

Intel-based D2 lynches then have a mislynch rate of 5/14 (36%) with 7/14 (50%) of intel-based D2 lynches ultimately leading to a village loss, while non-intel-based D2 lynches have a mislynch rate of 2/3 (67%) with 2/3rds (67%) of non-intel-based D2 lynches ultimately leading to a village loss. However, there's both a small sample size of non-intel-based D2 lynches, and a lack of any coherent meta scheme for picking whom to lynch on D2; if it's arbitrary, then wolves and other evils (e.g. the vampire) could easily influence it. My conclusion is, more experimentation is needed; like real communism, non-intel-based D2 lynches haven't been given much of a chance.

They have appeared in a few games since, but are not always included in a setup.  Items are either persistent or consumable. Consumable items disappear from the game once they have been used.  Items are either active or passive. Active items must be initiated by the Player that has control of them for them to work.  Passive and Consumable items such as Steel Armour or a Wolf Pelt will offer automatic protection from a single attack, but will be consumed and lost once an attack is blocked.  Items may be stolen by roles such as a thief, stolen by killing a player, or stolen by using a Potion of Acquiescence.  Items may also be passed to a player during the night.  More information regarding specific items will be added to the guide in good time.

Of course, killers might attempt to kill our poor Djinn tomorrow night, so either the PM passes me the Steel Armour and I use Avelda on the Djinn, drawing any kills to me or, vice-versa, I pass the ruin to the PM tonight and he Aveldas the Djinn. We can Shroud whoever Aveldas tomorrow night to protect against any poitential intel checks, by the next night we may even have another Kill +Swap available.

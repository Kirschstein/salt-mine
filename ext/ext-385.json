I have nothing to do with Scourge as he's not on my team afaik. That you decided to associate me unfairly with \"all of that\" is your own problem. 2) My comments from 19:14-21 were in reaction to my reading back over the day and were a general appeal to people to calm down and not take things to heart - it was not aimed specifically at you and was not an intent to stir things up again, although I can see how you may have taken it that way, as you seemed to take almost everything I said and escalate and conflate it with the situation earlier in the day yourself.  Note that Optimus agreed with my comments here though. 4) I genuinely regret the 19:43 \"be nice\" comment - I'd had a great day and was a celebratory glass down (hence genuinely not \"triggered\" as you repeatedly accused me), and it's the sort of sarcy comment I would make in pretty much any situation. I apologised, but you rejected this and called me a liar. 5) At no point have you expressed any remorse/regret for any of your actions that I can see, nor accepted any responsibility for your part in the escalation, when I put it to you that your words and actions have been unpleasant to read for many.  A lack of humility adds to the apparent air of infallibility you seem to think you have at playing this game. You have the power of being lit in this game, whereas I was clearly not, but that does not give you the right to make people feel like second class citizens and dictate to them how they absolutely should or shouldn't play - we are all real people behind the avatars.  Finally a quick comment on your insults towards the evil team - we can explain in detail later, but items/RNG unfortunately painted us into a corner very early from which there was very little escape.  The players on the team are not \"bad\", so I find your insults at us before knowing the set up offensive, but finding ourselves against the tightest lit circle I have seen for ages and other situations was unfortunate.  e.g. the SS claiming Prot (which has happened in several recent games by other players) being cc'd skillfully by Dirge w/o giving his role away (amazing play, if a little irritating to play against! :D), and a line of rune checks that went against us, etc.  Short of being psychic, there's not a lot different that we could have done, but some games are just like that.  Accept it and move on.  But please don't insult our intelligence.  I hope you take this feedback in the manner in which it is intended.  Thanking you kindly.

I was going over the line there and was causing lasting damage that even after the discussion calmed down and got more reasonable, caused a smite and hurt an individual I respect and love to play with. I had received a hint that I might go over the top around 12:55, and I really thought I toned it down quite a bit, but it was not enough. I should have stepped away completely and I heavily regret continuing playing at that moment. I feel especially bad since I clearly wanted to be in conflict with them, and I think it makes it look worse. I had no actual problem with Dirge, their play or their competence, but I heavily failed to keep myself calm enough to be very very clear about what I was going for and what my criticism was inside the game. The first thought in my head was “not like this, what have I done”, followed by sleepless nights. I wanted to play on the edge and it backfired in a very sad fashion I never intended to. I made great efforts in the last few games to keep the conflicts on an ingame level and reasonable enough for people to enjoy the rounds. This is a huge setback for me and I think for all my efforts to make up for it for some of the drama I caused a month ago. I’m deeply sorry about what happened and will try my absolute best to become a better player, a more pleasant person to play with. I absolutely failed at it this game and I hope you give me another chance to do right. I love this site very much, I love Kirschs’ work and I feel like shit for his birthday game going down the drain like that. I’m deeply sorry and ashamed.

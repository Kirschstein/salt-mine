The challenge, IMO, in the early game is to get activity going and maybe do some first hunting on a hunch or guesswork - so you're not relying on role claims/information just yet while still playing the game. If somebody tries to spark activity by doing a fake role claim, I think you're just missing the essential part, that is: we can play without role information. Also, if this becomes a regular thing, it will lose its value, because there will be more fake claims early in the game.

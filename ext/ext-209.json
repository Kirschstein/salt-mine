Harlot: Guessing who visits someone is dangerous, especially considering Harlots are generally supposed to visit the front-line targets to see what happens - maybe an Alphawolf worry could explain that away. Huntsman: Could visit whoever and just explain that you don't want to die yet, but you might be called on eventually and would happen to not die. Insomniac: No, because vanillagers probably don't exist at all in this game. Lycan: See Insomniac. Mason Leader: You will be annihilated if Masons are around in this game and try to claim this, but otherwise could work for pretending that we're all Masons. Messiah: Don't. Militia: Only if Furie is desperate. Protector: Maybe? You could just claim roleblock whenever this or some other similar role doesn't work properly, and it explains visits, but is questionable if you repeatedly don't go frontline and Harlot / Stalker notices. Reviver: Not without a Witch. Seer: Would require faction guesses constantly, but explains visits. Sleepwalker: See Insomniac. Stalker: Explains visits, but is risky, because you have to guess where your target went. Tarot Reader: Just don't.

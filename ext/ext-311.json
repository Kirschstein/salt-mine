Instead, these characters are developed separately from the main game, and can be downloaded into the game once finished. With this concept, characters that did not get into the official roster may be added by other developers even after the game finishes development.  Currently, the game does not support expansion characters, as the concept was initially dropped after the game's first major revamp following the 2011 demo, v0.7. However, it has been confirmed that expansion characters will likely become a thing following the release of the final version.

However, though I don't really completely agree with all her actions, as you said her claim wasn't even a CC, to which I agree, once she pushed it, instead of defending it with game logic, you said she had no life. Moreover, you used a lot of sarcasm and emoji, all those high school mockeries, most of which were well-timed more as a provocation rather than a joke, but that's subjective, so I didn't want to interfere; I only pointed out that you had no rights to complain when she responded to it; you asked for it. If you felt like her argument is weak and didn't feel like defending, you could've ignored her, which you said you would, but you never did. Combine that with the former, it's like you were deliberately picking on her, which I know it's probably not your intention, and I don't want to put words into old Pam's mouth, but that's how I saw it. The way the village handled it wasn't any better. She was expressing herself--it doesn't matter if it's her view on the game or simply just her feelings, and it was kind of both in this particular case--but then Noah came in to generalize that everyone would have to disagree with her because of this social toxic mindset that \"if you respond to a bully/aggressor/etc., you are also the bully/aggressor/etc. yourself because you have no rights to defend yourself; victim must be silent.\" It's not as dramatic as I put it, but I'm sure some part of her must've felt that way. And now they want to just move on without actually solving the issue; before now, there was no apologies, no clarification, no nothing, just a bunch of people yelling \"shut the fuck up.\" And how are we supposed to take matters to the mod or private chats when the game itself is supposed to disclose such information until it's over?","GameId":"ext-378","TimeStamp":"2020-07-21T19:26:15.9890225Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"AxlPrototype","Message":"She was playing the game, player her game.

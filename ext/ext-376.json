It was not my intention to make people quit or anything. Now the the reasons why I reacted the way I did. I consider myself a decent player and I have certain way I personally see how roles and factions should be played. I always try to think of the best play, espescially when I'm evil, I take quite some pride in how I play as evil normally. Now when the accusations today and yesterday came up, to me it always seemed like the suboptimal play to do, which is not what I do when I'm evil, or at least try to.  So this BMC trolling accusation annoyed me from the start, since I don't see it as a good play, and as we saw with Gene's reaction to my accusation, it can be quite insulting to be accused of something \"bad\" or \"bad play\". I tried to cut Gene off because I knew this argument gonna escalate. I tried several times to not engange in that discussion which ultimately lead to the \"this play is *beeeep*\".  MY problem with this BMC approach is that you can make ANY accustation what so ever towards anyone, as ridicolous as it may be, and explain it with \"just BMC sowing confusion\". I think this is an unhealthy approach to the game, and will cause a lot of trouble further one. I always played by the idea that I play with good players who try their BEST to win, so this ruled out several plays as unrealistic or just bad. This is and always will be an indication for me how I vote. If we go down the BMC can do ANYTHING and it's good because \"confusion\" route, we as village end up with nothing. There will be no standard to determine any evil, because everything is good and bad at the same time.  So I'm now here with as legit seer leading the votes, because of this meta established by Gene. Suicide plays become a thing as an accusation because BMC, and it will hurt village win chances in the long run. You're lynching in innocent person because Gene establish that doing suicide plays day 2 is a good way to play the game. And that's my big beef with Gene's accusations towards me. In any round without BMC I'd be legit af day 2 because that's no play any evil would risk. And I came out with the assumption that people assume I try to do my best no matter what faction I am. Basically \"My play is so village, because it's total suicide as evil\". Now I realise Gene has convinced people that doing suicide stuff is the new way to go, and it's a way I hate to go. I'll NEVER suicide if I don't have to, and I will always try to live as long as possible for my team and have the most impact on the game. Dying in a fire day 2 for me has none of that. You could argue you didn't nothing wronth with suiciding, but I see my skill level higher than that. Higher than just trolling day 2 and then die in a fire and say \"At least I made Annyong claim\", making Annyoing claim for me would be a quite low result on what impact I can have on a game, compared to all the other plays and work I can pull off during the game. While it may not be the wrong play to suicide day 2, I think I can do and will do more with what ever role and faction I'm given.  So I plead you to move the votes off me. If village goes down that route during this game, village WILL LOSE. Because we're throwing village's strength out of the window: Logic. If we discount logic with the BMC argument we don't have much left to judge. We have nothing left to distinguish a good check from a fake check. A good claim from a bad claim, and the truth for village will go down with it.","GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-07T12:18:27.4502856Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"lilfruini","Message":"Wow.","GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-07T12:21:50.2257816Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationRetractedEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Target":"lilfruini","PlayerName":"basilthedog89","GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-07T12:22:28.7170184Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"basilthedog89","Target":"marcweide","GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-07T12:22:28.7172924Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"lilfruini","Message":"(I despise my avatar so much, it looks like an unhealthy Bill Tannen.)","GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-07T12:22:30.4232976Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"basilthedog89","Message":"Ill move off you stan.

Use of meta is also not allowed and so therefore I can’t buy the whole “I would never play this way if I was X/Y/Z”, even if you suspect you know the player and how they stand on a particular play/issue.  The game is about lying and deceiving and so saying you would never do XYZ is completely allowed, but implying (or players interpreting that) you would never do XYZ because [meta - you know who that player is] is where the line gets fuzzy.  Having said that, you could also use that same meta to argue against exactly that if you are evil and have made a misjudgement or mistake. i.e. they know X would never do Y, so therefore I’m going to use that as an argument as to why I didn’t do that, even though I actually did.

I had my suspicions on him after yesterday, but his refusal to admit where he actually went and what he did last night secures him as evil for me today.  You lot will just have to make up your minds with what evidence you have and how you wish to judge it.  The play yesterday was (imo) clear evil with no real motivation to help village (i.e. claiming a Seer check and jumping on someone at 8:05 when the Sanguine Horn had just been blown… Not a smart/good play for any Seer imho.).  Follow that up with my stalk on him last night and his denials today and he’s solidly evil for me, even down to “being drunk” last night and accusing his visitors of foul play.

If I restored the Mason Sergeant, there is the chance that the sergeant itself could die when recruiting. Now, I know that the protector is still there and alive, but since your protect choices were unknown, there wasn't the guarantee of Maggie being protected the night they decide to recruit. Even so, if they were not protected, the wolves could kill them and whoever they chose to recruit could be framed as being a wolf since they died while the other masons knew who the recruit was. There was also the uncertainty of whether the group is lit or not. If they were not, which could come from the extremely odd choice of the darts being passed when neither Maeby or Maggie knew what each other's role was. If the group was not lit, they could immediately pass it over to the wolves (I'm not even sure what the setup is at this point. The single kills, no blocks???) If the recruit bounced with protection, that doesn't display which faction the recruit attempt was apart of.  With Larry, I was not sure whether they would shoot Gene or not. If they did, I could restore them and they would be able to shoot another person if intel had arisen. If not, then they'd have another shot saved if necessary.  For Gene, the dig on Kitty was odd. Possible two agitators? It wouldn't make too much sense with the small setup. I thought they were the safest option because they have the ability to prove whether they are a lit agitator or not. If they do not agitate, then a for sure evil has been found and there is a 100% solid lynch or shot. If they do agitate, intel based off of Maeby's dig could have helped determined possible lynches. Either way with them, an evil could be lynched.","Recipients":["Bardock","Park","Rox","name"],"Eavesdroppers":[],"GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T02:12:09.5618685Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.WerewolfNightMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"Sorry for the wall ","Recipients":["Bardock","Park","Rox","name"],"Eavesdroppers":[],"GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T02:12:14.6828783Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.WerewolfNightMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"I'm fairly certain if they try to recruit, they are going to protect Maggie the night of","Recipients":["Bardock","Park","Rox","name"],"Eavesdroppers":[],"GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T02:15:23.509531Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.WerewolfNightMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"I think I will restore them because if I say Gene that would be even more sus as is","Recipients":["Bardock","Park","Rox","name"],"Eavesdroppers":[],"GameId":"ext-376","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T02:44:00.7061566Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.WerewolfNightMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"I will restore them and try to come up with an argument.

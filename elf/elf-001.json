Rodney is now a parrot, Mary says (paraphrasing) 'regarding the parrot It lasts for a day, they remain a parrot for the rest of the game but from tomorrow can talk again, kind of'. So it's still Rodney, but with a different profile picture and name and trouble communicating, which goes away after a day. No-one’s dead, which can only mean protection or the wolves chose not to kill, I don’t see other reasons for this. I’ve not played loads of forum mafia but do the wolves ever really choose not to kill, except in some weird endgame situations? I don’t remember seeing it.  Notable things: Mary claims they were blocked, makes sense. Parrot claims ‘not protector’ then ‘no useful role’. No new info claimed. Other chat – I’d agree that Colin was AW, makes sense.

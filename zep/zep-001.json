Not sure what to make of Piglet's unprompted vanilla with no items claim.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:29:06.2394632Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"With that, it is time for food.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:29:22.8274363Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"Be back later.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:29:27.0415957Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Park","Message":"Some peoples entire contribution has been commenting on the memes / jokes and that's it.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:29:50.5239099Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Park","Message":"Which is actually worse. :p","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:30:15.1757654Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"InsertNameIndicatingWittynessandClass","Message":"I don't think I\"m doing much more","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:31:06.815415Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"InsertNameIndicatingWittynessandClass","Message":"Besides being a bit more active","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:31:12.248413Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"I'm not sure where I'd put myself within these stances","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:32:11.2204489Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"Also 3 people have not voted so far","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:32:53.0660439Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"I know Elsa and Aerith are two, not sure who the third is.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:34:26.358553Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"I think its someone who spoke but didn't vote because everyone else I think showed up.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:34:56.8055028Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"InsertNameIndicatingWittynessandClass","Message":"I'm surprised Aerith didn't die N1","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:35:33.5797965Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"InsertNameIndicatingWittynessandClass","Message":"Just 4 da memes","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:35:39.7603484Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"I thought someone else like Olaf would die N1 but even evils should know that's messed up","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:38:02.5652209Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"He just wants warm hugs","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:38:15.6853284Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Park","Message":"Aerith n1 kill would have been my play tbh.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:40:24.2491075Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Park","Message":"That or gooby.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:40:28.756684Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Park","Message":"Probably not gooby tbh, can't meme if they are dead.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-10T16:40:44.5413346Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"Woody Fri 16:35 I'm surprised Aerith didn't die N1 << (glaring at Aerith) I don't see why not.

First off, activity wise Aerith had a big change in activity from Day 6 onwards (after the lynch of Olaf). Day 5, Aerith was on first and last thing, before that they were on (infrequently) late in the day only. Day 6 onwards they've been reasonably active from about the same time every day. They wrote about 40 lines total until day 5, and since day 6 they're on 120 lines and counting. Another thing I picked up on was frequent smiley use before day 6, eg 2020-Jul-09 18:23:12 Aerith xD 2020-Jul-12 16:05:38 Aerith ^^. Since day 6, they've used 2 smilies in ~120 lines. Before day 6 they used 7 smileys in ~40 lines. Other than that there's some small differences, using \"Omegawolf\" and \"Direwolf\" before day 6 and then shortening to \"OW\" after day 6, using \"!\" a couple times before day 6 but none since. And to me, they don't sound quite the same, but that's subjective so please don't trust my judgment.","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-15T17:53:50.2525493Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"iain","Message":"Also, Olaf was never on in the morning, and almost everyone has been active in the morning since his lynch.

However, the TRs seemed to be a bit too strong when I thought about it so kept with the open setup but slow reveal of drunks.  Drunks: The OW could only kill ONE drunk on N1. So I could keep some important roles in play since they don’t visit. (Didn’t expect the OW to get caught so quickly, the fuck was that recruit :P) I like the idea of using them as part of trying to figure out what fits – masons? Seer? To have clues go throughout the game. Like the horn being with wolves, when it’s blown, you think BMC are in and probably a seer since one wasn’t in the original setup so it gives both village and evils a chance to figure out what they think fits. I like the freedom it gives to evils to claim outside the setup since it isn’t all known but have to figure out what they think would fit as a sober role.  I also used them to look like familiars to help the vampire hide a bit more so I had a GD, a cult follower (stalker) and a militia in the sober plan. I had a priority for the roles that needed to sober vs the ones that died.  I did give both “intended seers” whisper runes but unfortunately Winnie the Pooh hated Chipmunks so had to change the player for the real seer. I also had an issue with the final drunk sober since I hadn’t accounted for a sober timing after a revive, I waited until I think the day after, so he sobered at the same “time” Night time change so he didn’t get the dig as the GD was suppose to.  They had specific triggers: Gravedigger\tD3 Agitator\tD3 Seer\tN2 Militia\tD2 Beholder\tN3 BMC Stalker\tD2 BMC Seer\tN2  So the morning of D2 a BMC stalker and a militia spawn, two fam roles. Then at the end of D2 you get the seer and BMC seer so they both have a N2 check. Then on the second morning you got another fam role, GD and an agitator, that since items had already revealed might be suspected as an item. Then finally the beholder at the end of D3 if they were still alive.  I considered masons because WHO DOESN’T LOVE A GOOD FACTION WAR. But didn’t think village with wolves and vamp would be able to deal with a faction war as I like them so decided to see if BMC/ Vamp decided to try it :D I also think it wouldn’t be fair to have another group confirming villagers.","PlayerName":"TheZeppo95","OriginalName":"TheZeppo95","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-19T10:15:04.1247053Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.PostGameMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Message":"ALSO","PlayerName":"TheZeppo95","OriginalName":"TheZeppo95","GameId":"zep-001","TimeStamp":"2020-07-19T10:15:25.2848161Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.PostGameMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Message":"So I put this in thinking it would turn one person into a wolf escalating the kills to get numbers down since wolves would get that kill + OW.

However it apparently hasn’t been decided what happens when a bracer is on a familiar when a wolf attacks. It was a very slow-moving train crash when the BMC passed it to Donald on the same night he got famed. Anyway, that night Donald was transmuted into a vampire by the vamps transmute potion, then turned into a wolf. I decided based on the item that the kill would have been protected (protects from any harm from wolves) but that the item would still return to the wolves and fam returns to fam.

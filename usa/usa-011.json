If Trelawney claim = True, which is very likely due to hard to be aggressive like that as a wolf, McGona and Wormtail cannot be wolves together (but can both be sleepwalkers, this odd is insane if it is the case). If Wormtail is wolf, McG ain't one. Vice versa. Keep this in mind if Dumbledore is digged out as an Insomniac.  2. Luna and Nymph claimed Seer extremely early so I unfortunately believe they are genuine. While they could be wolf plays, there are many ways that it can go wrong and wolves might have expected a full claim later on rather than D2. Luna's push on Wormtail is a bit odd since Dumbledore pointed out, the odds that Seer found a wolf is way lower than the odds of finding a village. But I guess few other players also didn't see the setup (Seer/Insane Seer).  3. Dumbledore, whether village or wolf, confirms that Nymphadora did in fact visit him and no one else did. Even if he cannot see Nymph visiting him as a wolf, he is validating Nymphadora's status as a Seer/Blood Letter. If Dumbledore was a wolf, there is no reason to validate Nymph's status other than assuring the village that he is worth keeping so that he can Shift out the next day.  4. If both SW visited Trelawney, and we assume that the Seers are real, there is still a possibility still that both Wormtail and Dumbledore is good.

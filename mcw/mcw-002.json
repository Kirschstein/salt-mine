I'm fine with the view that we're all supposed to be evil together, I say: bring it on, build your case. There's still arguments for why Gama and/or me don't have to be complicit in a plot. I feel like we can dive into those some more, but also probably mostly if/once conflicting intel comes up. It's good to look at all four involved in the play today, but on the other hand it's also too simple for evils to say 'direct all attention to those people, don't look further, don't look in other directions'. That way they can at least trade their early loss of Nonon for some days of not being the subject of investigation.

I'm here, I've guzzled two cups of coffee (which have yet to do anything, but whatever), and I've read through. I think the most damning thing for this vote for me is Nono's reaction to the stack. They knew they were being pressured at 08:38, and only less than five minutes before had it been detailed out why the three visitors were being asked to claim. Over an hour later, their immediate response, rather than to read back and see why they're being stacked, is just to salt out about some imaginary \"sus for vanishing\" stack as if they were the only one not cooperating with the harlot's check, which had to be reiterated multiple times for them. Damned Harlot does not work in this scenario, in my opinion. Unless Todoroki magically also started with a sjon rune or clarity pot and happened to check one of the visitors, they wouldn't know who specifically to exclude from their visits. Risking exluding a villager who would have called them out would have been a suicide play. Really, so is outing a wolf (or vampire) right off the bat, as that would make them enemy number one. Other non-killing evil or damned with a rune might also not work, unless they plan to claim fake blocks until the rune recharges. Regardless, there's not enough evidence of Todoroki being even a hint of fake here. Not like there's evidence from Nonon's reaction to the accusation.","GameId":"mcw-002","TimeStamp":"2020-06-25T13:44:06.8097936Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"venko","Message":"I should have deleted that entry part.

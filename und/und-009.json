this is an umbrella term for 4 roles that a host can put into their setup (Hungry Ghoul - Starts on N1 with a kill power; Perceptive Ghoul - Starts with a check power; Cunning Ghoul - Starts with a stalk power; Regular Ghoul - Starts with no power). Ghoul is able to “feed” on a dead body and gain either a kill, check or stalk power. Until the Ghoul uses this power,, they cannot “feed” on another dead body. If the ghoul feeds on a fellow undead member who’s in GY, the Ghoul assumes that exact role for the rest of the game.  VD: Refer to H2P, there are no changes implemented on this role.  Necromancer: Refer to H2P as well. Only tweak to this role is that a necromancer is seen as a WC user.  Medium: No changes. Refer to H2P.  Banshee: Banshee is a role that activates it’s power upon being killed (the way a banshee dies doesn’t affect the activation itself, but it affects when the power can be used). After the banshee dies, they are able to possess any living player the morning after their death. Every night, the banshee returns to the GY and is able to possess any other player the next morning.

I had nothing to say and nothing to go on and wanted to let everyone know I was here and that I approve of placing ASV votes and am willing to make sure to place an ASV vote first to make myself the target of your anti ASV bullshit.  My activity pattern will be erratic because of my work and social schedule, however I would expect myself to be available and participating, for at least as much time every day as would actually be productive.  If you think that vote is enough to lynch me go ahead as I would rather be lynched in this game than continue this stupid debate on lynching the first person who places an ASV which leads to people actually being smited in the game who are active and in the game.  People are smited because they are afraid to place an ASV when they can, because of this cancer of a tactic.    I think everyone who has any chance of being smited should place an ASV while they are here immediately and it should not reflect on them otherwise.  If they never speak another word  I will support taking action on that, but acting like we should make ASV a lynching offense, when there is a game mechanic that demands it be done, is completely stupid and counter productive in my opinion.  I would love to talk about anything productive for the game, but I believe an obviously demanded action based on the game mechanics should not be held against players.  Just ask people random stupid questions or anything else, but we need people to avoid being smited and your tactic has in my opinion only produced active players being smited so far.","GameId":"und-009","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1540647524229)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ElectricPants","Message":"The is what I was talking about.

I really hope Flutter is evil at this point because if not their actions are so anti village they are certainly a big help to evil.  I was actually kind of joking when I said omega I did not think that was possible but I guess it is.  Nobody answered mr if best hunter is a thing in undead games if it ida we can explain 3 deaths as BH and evil death and vampire - there are other choices I think more likely but still unlikely - however a vampire being one of them should have been in shutterflys comments and his saying \"let's build a small circle of trust\" sounds like a perfect plan for a vamp - also keep in mind someone got recruited N1 is that is so we also need to be looking for helpers.

making the claim so obviously bad leads me to believe if you think rarity is purposely making a bad claim they don't actually want flutter dead - good chance we lynch flutter if no rarity claim anyway - my point being that so obviously framing flutter in so silly of a way actually helped flutters case rather than hurting it (unless anyone could be expected to believe rarities claim) we almost lynched him the night before - this being backed up by another UD to talk bad about rarity (cadence) gives a possible scenario where flutter is UD (and so is cadence) - I am not necessarily saying this is so, but thinking about what I believe to be true that is possible - 3 deaths on night 2 is still a mystery but I dont think flutter claiming militia after 3 deaths on N2 makes it for sure flutter killed someone and is not UD because militia with shot gone on random target seems to be the safest possible claim in this game","GameId":"und-009","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1540834494903)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"mmc1800","Message":"you guys keep talking about preloaded ghoul kill -

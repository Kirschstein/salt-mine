Original zombie is Igor (as we know) Fri 12:14 Original ghoul is Shock (in this theory, I will explain it) Fri 12:14 Now here is step by step stuff. Fri 12:20 D1 and 2, Igor is Zombie. On n2 he goes into Behemoth's body... so d3 and d4, behemoth is a zombie... (even though Mayor (the militia)) killed him zombie is still in behemoth... n4 he transfers into Shock, killing the ghoul in the process (so he can collect gy info on who to eat when he comes up since game has no medium).... now, on n6 is what could have been a village win but actually was not for this only reason!.... Wolfman known banshee at this point was killed by Igor, but I revived the ghoul the same night... so last living evil just changed place woth a dead one so the game continues... on d7 we lynched a wrong person... and now, on d8....

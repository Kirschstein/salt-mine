I have RL today so I do not have time to hang out and discuss much.  I have skimmed through today.  When the day ended yesterday I was trying to lynch clown.  I am still sus of BatKid, his not giving any answer and waiting to say who he blocked and keeping all of his doors open is not helping his case any in my mind, I feel as if he and I are cross stories are CCs of each other and I am not sure why nobody is following up on that (and so I am not throwing out my check for him to confirm himself after as it making sense any more than he is).  I am most sus and feel like it would be most productive to lynch Clown and I am a bit annoyed at nobody showing up and not even giving a reason not to lynch him yesterday.  I feel like Dr. has a tin hat on and seems to be jumping from one crazy accusation to another, I am thinking possibly he could be the zombo and is trying to get a lynch to stick.  Yesterday and today we have a zombie if I am not wrong about the mechanics of the VD and the zombie was active so I sus one of you active speakers as a zombie, as we have not identified one (and I also find this odd that nobody even mentions it, and makes me think we might have double zombies if we have a banshee as well as a VD and I am finding it hard to trust even multiple claims).  I do agree we should lynch someone who could be UD rather than lynching corpses forever.  I feel like going off in 20 directions is not helpful, and so I advocate for a lynch on clown, exactly where I ended the day yesterday and I see nothing to push us anywhere else.  Here are my top susses in order (batkid (ccs me and his story doesn't make sense), clown (cc to shock and has a horrible claim and has not helped himself in my eyes today), shock (is the other end of this CC so I sus hi, - though I think he is more lit than other people and I would not lynch him equally with clown - I will want to wait for a dig of clown to lynch), drfink (his seems like some kind of evil trying to throw lots of bullshit tinhat theories out and never really backs them up).  I will check back in for a bit here and there and try to find a good time to put my check/info into this mix, but I am not leading into this very sus set of people talking with my stuff until I hear from my CC/verify partner and/or if I feel it will make a difference in who we lynch today because we have a lot of claims out still that might be caught by my checks/info.","GameId":"xms-006","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1546099604055)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"mmc1800","Target":"Sh00ter","GameId":"xms-006","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1546099617072)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"orucsoraihc","Message":"Wow","GameId":"xms-006","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1546099632178)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"orucsoraihc","Message":"That's a paragraph","GameId":"xms-006","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1546099637147)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"mmc1800","Message":"Sorry I do not have time to sit here for hours in a back and forth, and that is what I can contribute for this part of today.

be able to chime in from time to time, and I have still not left the house.  @behemoth The idea you are leading lynch on Shock because you think he is a lit stalker and outed a PR and that you think we should keep wolves/vamps alive makes no sense to me.  You seem to have completely missed the uber likely possibility that a lethal visit is a vamp, and advocating to keep evils alive now puts Behemoth on my sus list as being so smart as to put someone down for sharing a lethal visit and still forgetting there are likely vamps in this game (if that was an evil kill) and we have almost completely ruled out a wolfpack seems super sus to me.  I am not sure what the kill last night means, but if I am following my mechanics correctly it is super unlikely it came from UD.  If that is a MW/militia kill and it came from sax, and they got seen which Shock said first thing and gave them a chance to say more or less anything they wanted before he said what happened, nobody mentioned that giving his check would be a bad idea if it was a lethal visit (and it had not come to my mind so I can give Shock a pass on that).  Sax would/should show up and say if he is good and made that kill at this point.  I am not buying Clowns act at all.  Nothing shock has said or done so far has been countered by anything solid, I am not necessarily against lynching them both, but I think we can verify one by digging the other, and the order should be clown first because he is way more sus from my POV now than Shock (that has not changed).  Also Clown's proposal that his CC check him does not make any sense at all to me, and undeads can make non lethal visits on the night he is asking to be checked on (if he is asking someone else to stalk him), which makes perfect sense for a ghoul to be claiming seer.  Shock's check seems far more risky to me, he is claiming someone made a lethal visit so it is super likely to lead to a CC and could have other intel to go against it.  When evaluating claims I take into consideration the risk of the checks if they are made up, and today Shock is winning the battle in that department (as he did yesterday when he guessed my movements in advance of me sharing them which is why I tend to trust him more).","GameId":"xms-006","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1546103163701)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"mmc1800","Message":"I should say when he would have had to guess my movements in advance of me sharing them.","GameId":"xms-006","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1546103328530)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"dittemaersk","Message":"But what I don't understand is the three votes on Shock.

It seems like we might be doing fine, I think the clown lynch was solid and he seemed to be consistent from the start so I hope he was not a zombie.  I am undecided about BatKid being a zombie.  I am hoping he was the zombie and we have a GW somewhere, but I wish they would stop picking the same corpses as me.  I did finally get a dig in last night, but it is a killing role and I feel like sharing more details about that check will help UD way more than it helps us decide who to lynch, at the moment the GY is pretty crowded with unknowns so I would rather keep them guessing about where the killing roles are.

I guess this is part of the design. Now there's a timer on our killing roles since MWs need to eat and also because I assume UD will have some killing ability which will allow them to kill our killing roles and thus get more killing power. So that's a loop. So countering the Undead I think we need to make haste with generating public infos (with many claims) so that we can push on, but this will probably play into the hands of Coven most at the moment.

This is a hard game to win for everyone involved but the first night and day will probably decide who has the upper hand.  Try to be active, the setup somewhat requires it - everyone has a part to play! If for whatever reason something comes up and you can't play, let me or Kirsch know and we can sub you - which is better than smiting or only playing at minimal activity.   Most of all have fun.

As I said yesterday (and Pride initially agreed) we should lynch the wolves to remove their killing ability, then deal with the Coven at our leisure. However, it seemed to me like he was attempting to save Jerso and it failed, hence his reaction to the votes changing. I also think that since he came out as Militia his attitude and mannerisms have changed, he's a lot less aggressive than previously. Today he's also going after Coven again, despite agreeing with me about wolves being a bigger threat. I believe because of both of these point to him being shifted, laying low to take the attention away from the wolves after Jerso was lynched. Maes and Kimblee seem to be the same as they were previously to me, though I'm also suspicious of Kimblee for being so insistent on going after Coven even after they themselves outlined that they aren't a threat, but since I think it's the same person, if she is a wolf I think she always has been.

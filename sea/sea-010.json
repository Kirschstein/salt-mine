We could kill only once every other night, and so many intels and so many items are spread among the village; there was even a shield to block a kill. Like, how was undead even supposed to have a chance? It relies so much on mislynches, but there are just too few hiding spots we could blend in. I think the only chance we'd have had was to literally just steal every item with a very strict kill-order that we had to somehow magically know.

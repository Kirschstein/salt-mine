What if Teddy is coven? In that case the remaining coven would have to be Teddy/Derek, or Teddy/Derek/Erica, or Teddy/Richard/Derek but i find that one least likely. Okay so if coven redirected Jack n1 onto Richard and he claimed blocked, then they could probably assume Jack was a court or DW, witch kill him n2, and have a non-lethal visiting role, Teddy, claim court instead. She could then claim responsibility for richard's block, say she was on Jack n2 when he was dead and couldn't contest it, then have Derek help her with the claim for n3. Owen stalked her n4 and caught her visiting Amelia, who died and the maple didn't take credit for it, maybe a shaman lure? Teddy would be able to non-lethal visit with a protect totem, and kill once with the lure even if no wolves because of the \"phantom wolves\" thing that was mentioned a few days ago iirc. Arizona and Addison were probably the witch/djinn, and then Cristina was the succ. This is why I think it might only be Teddy/Derek now and not Teddy/Derek/Erica because a 6 man team is pretty big especially with 2 puppets. Derek would be the PM and Meredith and/or Jackson the puppets. If only one, then the other puppet might have been Ben like we thought early on. With derek having already claimed it, and Arizona/Addison dead, and Cristina not able to risk claiming blocked as Owen might stalk her when they needed to redirect Leah for her killing, then no one in the coven could help with the RB claim believably and that's why Teddy has claimed to not visit for two days. Now, that makes me think Erica might not be involved in spite of my earlier idea because Teddy has been getting heat for her (lack of) blocks and Erica was still under suspicion for her vanilla claim. If Teddy claimed she blocked Erica after Erica denied being blocked, she could sway people to lynch her, and if that didn't work she could claim redirected like she did to try and point the finger at me as being a succubus again as I'm an easy target. I was thinking on this in the shower this morning so I haven't had a chance to completely double check everything, and I know it doesn't explain Owen/Leah's deaths which I still need to think about, but it's been sticking in my head since I went to bed last night.","GameId":"smc-512","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1526326465659)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lore","Message":"Oof, sorry for wall of text","GameId":"smc-512","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1526326472520)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationRetractedEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Target":"StormPooper","PlayerName":"Lore","GameId":"smc-512","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1526326655793)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lore","Target":"XII","GameId":"smc-512","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1526326655842)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ctsk","Message":"So that's a theory","GameId":"smc-512","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1526326702078)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"StormPooper","Message":"Richard has also claimed to be blocked, how would he fit into that?","GameId":"smc-512","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1526326720495)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lore","Message":"I included that erica","GameId":"smc-512","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1526326738576)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"StormPooper","Message":"Sorry, I've read it a couple of times and missed that, will re-read","GameId":"smc-512","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1526326752509)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"StormPooper","Message":"Ah, sorry, missed the bit about claiming Richard's block.

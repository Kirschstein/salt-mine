Looking into the BMC, if there's only 2 of them, I'd suspect the Leader is the one missing - making the BMC more of a wolf-adjacent faction than a pure faction of their own. Town calling me out, and voting me, for bringing up Smug's playstyle when the horn was being discussed is a pretty shite one - I made that point when 2 or 3 people had SPECULATED about the horn, it hadn't been claimed yet. Additionally, I wouldn't speculate about it, as I don't reeeeally know what it does (sorry). I'm not sure about Crea's claim. I get why it was made. I also get why some don't want to lynch her. (good job Town is dead, or he'd want to lynch me for talking about both sides!) My preference would be for the horn to be passed, but not have it announced who it was given to. At the start of the game, we didn't know Crea had it. If Crea passes it (or maybe doesn't - woah) to a secret, but trusted to Crea, person, we're back to where we started, but with the added knowledge of the horn being in the game. That means we don't need to lynch a villager and it means wolves won't want to kill Crea. Problem solved. I don't like Shabas's \"ahh, I was testing you!\" response, it seemed more like his initial vote was a joke, which Smug took wrongly? (seriously, who'd follow Helix on a vote?)
